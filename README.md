E-commerce website built using React and Redux.
Integrates with the Stripe API to demonstrate real payments and with Firebase to handle users authentication and storage.
This project is still ongoing and so far has helped me to establish my knowledge about JSX, the virtual DOM, life-cycle methods, routing, higher-order components and React Hooks.
